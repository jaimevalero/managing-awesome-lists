It's a PCAP-based tool that allows you to specify an extended regular or hexadecimal expression to match against data payloads of packets. It understands many kinds of protocols, including IPv4/6, TCP, UDP, ICMPv4/6, IGMP and Raw, across a wide variety of interface types, and understands BPF filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.","topics":["sniffer","grepping"],"created_at":"2009-12-30T08:14:15Z","pushed_at":"2023-10-05T18:48:24Z","stargazers_count":817,"language":"Shell"},{"full_name":"aofei/mimesniffer","description":"A MIME type sniffer for Go.","topics":["mimesniffer","mime","type","content-type","file-signature","file-format","magic-number","sniffer","go"],"created_at":"2018-12-20T03:40:20Z","pushed_at":"2022-08-04T09:11:36Z","stargazers_count":32,"language":"Go"}],"frecuent_topics":{"sniffer":4,"pcap":2,"pcapng":1,"packet-capture":1,"libpcap":1}}
